- **UserService**: Password and avatar update functionality with validation
- **REST API**: Endpoints for password change and avatar upload
- **GraphQL**: Mutations for user settings operations
- **Security**: BCrypt hashing, JWT authentication, file upload validation
- **File Storage**: Secure avatar storage with UUID-based naming

### üîÑ Next Phase: Frontend API Integration
- Update TypeScript types to include avatarUrl

## Current State Analysis

### Backend (/task-manager)
- **User Model**: Contains basic fields (id, username, email, firstName, lastName, password, role, timestamps, avatarUrl)
- **UserService**: Has basic CRUD operations plus password update and avatar update functionality with validation
- **GraphQL Schema**: Has basic user mutations plus password update and avatar update mutations
- **File Upload**: Existing file upload controller for task attachments, plus dedicated avatar upload endpoints
- **Database**: H2 database with JPA entities (avatarUrl field added)
- **Security**: BCrypt password hashing, JWT authentication, file upload validation
- **API Endpoints**: REST endpoints for password and avatar updates, GraphQL mutations available

### Frontend (/task-manager-web)
- **User Type**: Basic user interface without avatar field
- **Auth Store**: Basic authentication state management
- **API Layer**: GraphQL client with typed queries
- **Navigation**: Side menu with main app sections
- **UI Components**: TailwindCSS with Svelte components

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Architecture
```
User Settings Flow:
1. User requests settings page ‚Üí Frontend serves settings UI
2. User submits password change ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí GraphQL mutation ‚Üí UserService
3. User uploads avatar ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí File upload ‚Üí UserService updates avatar URL
4. Backend validates and processes updates ‚Üí Database updates ‚Üí GraphQL response
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
Settings Page Structure:
- SettingsLayout (container)
  - PasswordSection (form with current password, new password, confirm)
  - AvatarSection (file upload, preview, current avatar display)
  - ProfileSection (display current user info, read-only)
  - Save buttons and feedback
```

## Implementation Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Backend Foundation (COMPLETED - December 20, 2024)
**Completed Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated User model with avatarUrl field and multiple constructors
2. ‚úÖ Added password update functionality to UserService with validation
3. ‚úÖ Created avatar upload REST endpoints in UserController
4. ‚úÖ Updated GraphQL schema with avatarUrl field and new mutations
5. ‚úÖ Added GraphQL mutation resolvers for password and avatar updates
6. ‚úÖ Implemented file upload validation and secure storage
7. ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and security measures

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Password hashing with BCrypt encoder
- Avatar file validation (type, size limits)
- REST API endpoints: `/api/user/password`, `/api/user/avatar`
- GraphQL mutations: `updateUserPassword`, `updateUserAvatar`
- Secure file storage in `uploads/avatars/` directory
- JWT authentication for all endpoints
- File size limits (5MB) and type validation (images only)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used constructor overloading pattern for User model flexibility
- Implemented both REST and GraphQL APIs for different use cases
- Added comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Used UUID-based unique filename generation for avatars

### Phase 2: Frontend API Integration (Week 1 - In Progress)
1. Update TypeScript types to include avatarUrl
2. Create API functions for user settings operations
3. Update auth store to handle avatar display
4. Test API integration

### Phase 3: User Interface (Week 1-2)
1. Create settings page components
2. Implement password change form with validation
3. Implement avatar upload with preview
4. Add navigation and routing
5. Style and polish UI

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 2)
1. End-to-end testing
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. Performance optimization
4. Security testing
5. User acceptance testing

## Lessons Learned from Phase 1 Implementation

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well:
1. **Constructor Overloading Pattern**: Multiple constructors provided flexibility for different use cases
2. **Dual API Approach**: Both REST and GraphQL endpoints offer maximum compatibility
3. **Security First**: BCrypt integration and file validation were implemented robustly
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with meaningful messages
5. **File Upload Strategy**: UUID-based naming prevented conflicts and enhanced security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Encountered:
1. **UserRepository Dependency**: Initially tried to inject UserRepository into UserController, but simplified by using UserService methods
2. **Import Management**: Multiple imports required careful organization
3. **Constructor Complexity**: Multiple constructors in User model, while functional, could benefit from Builder pattern in future

### üîß Technical Decisions Validated:
1. **REST + GraphQL**: Having both API types was the right choice for flexibility
2. **File Storage Location**: `uploads/avatars/` directory structure works well
3. **Validation Levels**: Server-side validation at both service and controller layers
4. **Security Implementation**: JWT authentication with role-based access control

### üìà Timeline Adjustment:
- **Phase 1**: Completed faster than expected (1 day vs 1 week planned)
- **Overall Project**: Accelerated by ~1 week
- **Remaining Phases**: Still achievable within adjusted timeframe
